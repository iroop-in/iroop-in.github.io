            <h4>E-Learning</h4>
            <p>
              E-learning can be described as a learning system comprised of structured/unstructured teaching made possible with the help of online and electronic resources. While teaching can be based in or out of the classrooms, the use of computers and the Internet forms the major component of E-learning. E-learning can also be termed as a network enabled transfer of skills and knowledge, and the delivery of education is made to a large number of recipients at the same or different times. Earlier, it was not accepted wholeheartedly as it was assumed that this system lacked the human element required in learning.
              
            </p>
            <h4>Customer Disengagement</h4>
            <p>
              Recently, plenty of research was conducted on engagement more particular on enhancing Customer Engagement (CE). The flip side of CE, namely Customer Disengagement (CDE), seems to be uncharted. Thus,this report elaborates a working definition on CDE. This includes the interrelation of CE and CDE. According to this report, CDE is described as a psychological process that can cause the state of complete detachment from a Brand or Service (B/S). CDE could have behavioural outcomes in terms of Negative Customer Engagement (NCE). Additionally, it interrelates with former CE levels and varies across contexts. CDE is supposed to be a promising research field.

            <h1>What is Gamification?</h1>
            <blockquote>Gamification is the process of taking something that already exists â a website, an enterprise application, an online community â and integrating game mechanics into it to motivate participation, engagement, loyalty and to obtain game dynamics from it.
                <div class="has-text-right"> - Nir eyal </div></blockquote>
            <p>
                Gamification â the application of game mechanics into nongame activities and processesâis a proven, powerful strategy for engaging, influencing and motivating diverse groups of people. The business community has just begun to realize the power of gamification to enhance customer interaction, build loyalty, andincentivize employees and partners. And the concept has the potential to solve a variety of obstacles outside the traditional business environment as well, in areas such as Health & Wellness, Education & Training and Public Policy & Government.
            </p>

            <p>
                Gamification as per recent researches has found its way in user engagement and retention. Consumers of e-Learning platforms tend to get bored with one way communication, followed by poor retention of users in this competitive world. Thus studying user behavior to get things done has become a popular among platforms. Game elements helps to engage user by giving sense of achievement, loss of progress or competitiveness among peers. Major giants like Facebook and Instagram thrive on gamification for maintaining the huge user base.

              <h1>Problem</h1>
              
              <p>
                  In starting phase of a product based startup, the most delicate concern surmounts the lead generation. Though decent userbase exist for the company (20000+ registrations of professional chess players as well as aspirants) the stats clearly projects retention of users as the major issue for the time being. This indicated that although the organization exhibit expansive growth in registrations, it still lacked a good retention of students on our e-learning platform. The log analysis report (section 3.1) put forward the dropout rates across existing content on platform, thus depicting the lack of favourable consumer interaction elements on the platform.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Following points jot down the major issues involved:
                  <br>    
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Lack of data point in log analysis</strong> to measure existing engaging components on companyâs website.

                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Non-existence of feedback forms</strong> to capture direct experiences of the students engaging on platform: The sales team in collaboration of world class GMs was responsible for introducing and materializing the products, but still lacked the user feedbacks (qualitative as well as quantitative) capturing consumer experience on the newly launched platform
  
  
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Absence of tracking behavioural aspects of users </strong> engaging on platform followed by lack of user profiling for personalization: User dynamics play a vital role in retention. Capturing and analysing user interaction data (clicks, scrolls, hovers) across various product categories (dream room, camp room, live room) becomes crucial on what times across global locations

                To solve the above mentioned problem statements, there are some objectives to be completed in order so that it can result in positive outcomes of user engagements. The objectives are decided on what kind of problems are to be solved and they are segmented according to those. If the mentioned objectives are not met, the effectiveness of the solution will not meet the expected metrics. Here below are the objectives that I finished and are being implemented in shortime.
                <br>

                    <strong>Exploration of game mechanics - </strong> Game mechanics which are part of gamification along with game dynamics play a major role in increasing user engagement by introducing different game elements into the platform. Game mechanics include elements known by most of the present generation where they are totally motivated and trigged by them. Some of the game mechanics and elements are explained later.

                  <li>
                      <strong>Propose a model for enhancing user engagement on nurtrâs platform - </strong> To continue further and analyse the problem statements and to have a solution, there should be a model to be produced which states how the process is going to be carried on from the very first by analyzing data points. This will be the core for user engagement metrics for the future endeavours. The whole point of having model is that some states in the model at some stage can be modified according to the data points received. This will give an advantage to move further and solve future objectives with utmost ease.
                  </li>
                  <br>
                  <li>
                      <strong>To measure the effectiveness of the proposed model - </strong> There should be constant testing and improvement of the model to gain 40% plus metrics within certain time. The model should be measured after implementing and then again should be proposed again which includes further improvements. So, the effectiveness should be measured efficiently along with iteration of design elements for gaining more traction and to increase user engagement.
