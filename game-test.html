						This came to my mind when I realized the engagement rate is par low along with the conversion rate. I tried to change the inner pages which resulted in v2 of the website and discussed in other project but Gamification is much more interesting than what we think.
						
					</p>
					<p>
						This case study introduces the gamification model that is being implemented at nurtr. The model includes user behavior analytics over implemented game elements like of <strong> daily puzzle, email campaign management for cold users by sending passive notification and introduction of games for competitiveness</strong>. All this can help to tackle the problem of user attrition and enhance user experience on platform as well.

              The volumes are large, the information comes in a variety of data types, and it’s coming in at a high velocity. Yes, I am talking about organizations processing thousands of events a day, such as <strong>nurtr</strong>, with about <strong>12000 subscribers </strong>generating gigabytes of data. The huge volume of log data generated by today’s enterprises presents IT professionals with both a challenge and an opportunity. The challenge is managing large amounts of unstructured data. The opportunity is turning that data into actionable insights that can have a meaningful impact on the business or organization. Two of the biggest barriers to timely problem resolution are managing the volume of log data and knowing the right questions to ask to increase engagement.
              <br>
              <br>
              Also, in this scalable environment, monitoring the infrastructures is of utmost importance for the organization.

            <h3>E-Learning</h3>
            <p>
              A learning system based on formalised teaching but with the help of electronic resources is known as E-learning. While teaching can be based in or out of the classrooms, the use of computers and the Internet forms the major component of E-learning. E-learning can also be termed as a network enabled transfer of skills and knowledge, and the delivery of education is made to a large number of recipients at the same or different times. Earlier, it was not accepted wholeheartedly as it was assumed that this system lacked the human element required in learning.
              <br>
              <br>
              <strong>Description :</strong> E-Learning has proved to be the best means in the corporate sector, especially when training programs are conducted by MNCs for professionals across the globe and employees are able to acquire important skills while sitting in a board room, or by having seminars, which are conducted for employees of the same or the different organizations under one roof. The schools which use E-learning technologies are a step ahead of those which still have the traditional approach towards learning.

            <h3>Customer Disengagement</h3>
            <p>
              Recently, plenty of research was conducted on engagement more particular on enhancing Customer Engagement (CE). The flip side of CE, namely Customer Disengagement (CDE), seems to be uncharted. Thus,this report elaborates a working definition on CDE. This includes the interrelation of CE and CDE. According to this report, CDE is described as a psychological process that can cause the state of complete detachment from a Brand or Service (B/S). CDE could have behavioural outcomes in terms of Negative Customer Engagement (NCE). Additionally, it interrelates with former CE levels and varies across contexts. CDE is supposed to be a promising research field.
